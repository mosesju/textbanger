# Basic Text Message Service
This project is going to send text messages to clients stored in an airtable database. To be used by a fitness client looking to expand they're marketing reach into different areas. Since it is an MVP I decidied to use really simple tools. For example my backend was written using Flask. No authentication or anything, just like if you have the link you can send texts. This is meant to be an MVP
## Tools
- Flask - Routing
- Flask WTForms - Forms
- Twilio - Sending SMS
- Airtable - Database

## Extensions
I will secure it with a password for the users and save messages that have been sent. Also give it some style and stuff would be smart
Make it a Django project so I can add authentication and stuff.
